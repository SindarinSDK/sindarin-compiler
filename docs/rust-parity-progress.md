# Rust backend completion ledger

Goal: verified feature and behavioral parity with C on integrated main, preserving
the established language contract and C as the default target. Rejections are
remaining implementation work, not parity. This ledger supersedes historical
head counts, not the language specification or the historical evidence itself.

## Baseline: 2026-10-02

Remote main verified as `4dba66c151133f83bf4e11a5b0c12c414384bb6a`.
Isolated branch: `integration/rust-parity-completion`. The older conflicted main
checkout is untouched. Linux aarch64, GCC 13.3.0, rustc 1.93.1; Release CMake
build with Ninja, eight build workers; test runners use their default 20 workers.
Existing project-local libs copied into `.sn`; no host software changes.

Commands: `cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc`, `cmake --build build -j 8`,
`python3 scripts/run_rust_tests.py all --no-cleanup --no-color --verbose`,
`python3 scripts/run_tests.py all --no-cleanup --verbose`, and
`python3 tests/rgen/byte_string_compare.py`.

| Suite | Pass | Fail | Skip |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust generation | 295 | 16 | 0 |
| Rust negatives | 164 | 13 | 5 |
| Native tagged / extra / origin / negative | 6 / 12 / 1 / 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Closures positive / negative | 36 / 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Rust toolchain | 12 | 0 | 0 |
| C unit / cgen / model | 1608 / 107 / 79 | 0 | 0 |
| C integration / negative | 1141 / 58 | 0 | 0 |
| C exploratory | 223 | 1 | 0 |
| C exploratory negative | 11 | 0 | 0 |

Raw-byte comparisons: 63 executions pass, including ten C/Rust paired fixtures
at O0/O1/O2 and three Rust-only raw argv executions. Raw logs are retained in
`rust-parity-evidence/main-4dba66c-*.log`.

The C failure is `test_limitation_closure_array`: AddressSanitizer reports a
heap-buffer-overflow in concurrent `sn_array_push_safe`, with another thread
reallocating the storage. Do not mask it by rerunning until green or excluding it.
Determine the defined synchronization contract before making a semantic change.

Rust failures include shared-frontend admission failures, stale generated-source
snapshots after byte-string support, and obsolete negative expectations. Each
needs classification and behavior verification; do not bulk bless snapshots.
Five skips are explicit promotions to closure regression tests; trace their
coverage and remove redundant skipped entries when equivalence is verified.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Current full Rust baseline failures classified and resolved without altering C oracles.
- [ ] Receiver alias forwarding: PR150 (`a53de135`) integrated and reverified.
- [ ] General array identity, indexed/nested ownership, dynamic aliases and rebinding.
- [ ] Remaining closure captures, callable contexts and reference lifetimes.
- [ ] Concurrency/globals/synchronization: reconcile PR127, PR133, PR134, PR142.
- [ ] Native managed transport, pointers, structs, callbacks and SDK: reconcile PR143 and remaining gaps.
- [ ] Remaining string, numeric, matching, reflection, module and type features inventoried and completed.
- [ ] Platform runtime gates: PR144 Windows failures resolved; Linux/macOS/Windows green on final head.
- [ ] Automated differential coverage of behavior, raw streams, status, order, mutation and lifetimes across modes.
- [ ] C baseline sanitizer failure explained/resolved within established language semantics.
- [ ] Full integrated suites pass without unexplained failures or hidden skips.
- [ ] All changes merged into main; accurate architecture/usage/coverage docs and final evidence report.

## Integration queue

Live inspection: PR150 has green three-platform compiler checks and is mergeable.
PR144 has failed Windows compiler/runtime checks. PR127, PR133 and PR143 have
merge conflicts; PR134 and PR142 are mergeable but depend on unmerged foundations.
PR descriptions and historical focused gates are not final-head verification.
Current main CI does not execute the complete Rust suite.

PR150 is being composed locally first. No remote merge has occurred in this goal.

## Local integration results

PR150 head `a53de135e1e0c4a980ae23aff6c093aa9daf3e32` fast-forwarded
into the isolated branch. Rebuild succeeds. Full Rust suite: 300 generation passes,
16 generation failures; all other suite totals unchanged. The 29 failing
case/reason pairs match the baseline (durations are not part of the comparison).
Five receiver fixtures pass in 15 source-identical C/Rust pairs at O0/O1/O2, with
zero compile/run statuses and identical raw stdout/stderr. Evidence:
`pr150-rust.log` and `pr150-receiver-pairs.json`. Remote PR remains open.

Corrected three obsolete statement-match rejection messages to include the already
implemented char subject. No source fixture, runtime oracle or compiler behavior
changed. Focused `rgen-errors --filter statement_match_` passes; see
`statement-match-negatives.log`. This removes three stale test failures, not three
language gaps. The next full negative run is required after further changes.

Raw harness logs deliberately retain terminal progress carriage returns and
trailing spaces; whitespace checks apply to source/docs edits, excluding these
unmodified captured logs. They also retain failure traces and statuses.

## Iterator unchecked-mode repair and differential gate

Added `scripts/check_rust_parity.py` and `make test-rust-parity-core`. The gate
requires an explicit nonempty fixture selection, existing sources/compiler,
successful compilation and zero runtime status on both targets. It compares raw
stdout/stderr and records compiler/source SHA-256 hashes, commands, statuses and
raw streams in JSON. Missing artifacts, timeouts and failed controls fail the
gate; special `.args`/`.exit`/`.panic` contracts are explicitly rejected rather
than silently ignored. This positive gate complements, not replaces, negatives
and independent runtime expectations.

Differential testing exposed Rust rejection of signed iterator-binding postfix
mutation in unchecked O2. Removed the obsolete checked-only validation guard:
these bindings are mutable local copies and existing local lowering applies.
The same unchanged comprehensive iterator source now matches C at O0/O1/O2.
All six neighboring iterator negative tests pass. No C/shared production changed.

Refreshed five stale generated-Rust snapshots only after paired execution checks:
by-value scalar assignment (checked and unchecked fixture), numeric mutations,
iterator mutations and resolved callable methods. Existing sources and runtime
expectations are unchanged. The rgen runner verifies those expectations after
snapshot matching: now 305 passes, 11 failures, no skips. The core differential
gate passes all 30 pairs (60 executions), covering those five fixtures plus the
five receiver-alias fixtures at each optimization level. Evidence is
`core-after-iterator.json` and `rgen-after-snapshot-repair.log`.

The separate `resolved_calls.sn` historical Rust fixture fails C compilation at
all three optimization levels: heap-owning operator arguments are emitted as
values where C expects pointers. Rust executes it successfully. Do not claim it
as C parity evidence or change C semantics merely to satisfy this Rust fixture.
Its snapshot remains unresolved separately from the real iterator gap.
