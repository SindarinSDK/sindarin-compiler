// Test 108: Non-primitive attempting to escape private block (should error)
// This test verifies that the type checker correctly rejects attempts
// to assign non-primitive types (arrays, strings) to variables declared
// outside a private block.
//
// EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: This test should FAIL COMPILATION with an error about
// non-primitive types not being able to escape private blocks.
