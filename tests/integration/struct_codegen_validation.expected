=== Struct Code Generation Validation ===

--- Testing Basic Field Types ---
field_int: PASS
field_int32: PASS
field_double: PASS
field_char: PASS
field_bool: PASS
field_byte: PASS

--- Testing Nested Structs ---
nested point.x: PASS
nested point.y: PASS
nested value: PASS

--- Testing Packed Struct Size ---
PackedData sizeof=10: PASS (expected 10)

--- Testing Unpacked Struct Alignment ---
AfterPacked sizeof=24: checking alignment
AfterPacked alignment: PASS (size >= 17)

--- C Type Sizes ---
int: 8 bytes
int32: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes
float: 4 bytes
char: 1 bytes
bool: 1 bytes
byte: 1 bytes
sizeof(int) == 8: PASS
sizeof(int32) == 4: PASS
sizeof(double) == 8: PASS
sizeof(float) == 4: PASS
