=== UUID Integration Tests ===
--- Factory Methods ---
  PASS: UUID.new() succeeded
  PASS: UUID.create() succeeded
  PASS: UUID.v7() succeeded
  PASS: UUID.v4() succeeded

--- Version Verification ---
  PASS: v7 UUID reports version 7
  PASS: v4 UUID reports version 4

--- toString Method ---
  PASS: toString() returns 36-char string
  PASS: Different UUIDs have different string representations

--- equals Method ---
  PASS: Different UUIDs are not equal
  PASS: Same UUID equals itself

--- String Parsing ---
  PASS: UUID.fromString() round-trips correctly

--- V5 Deterministic UUIDs ---
  PASS: Namespace URL is correct
  PASS: v5 with same input produces same UUID
  PASS: v5 with different input produces different UUID
  PASS: v5 UUID reports version 5

--- Variant Check ---
  PASS: UUID variant is 1 (RFC 9562)

--- Timestamp Extraction (v7) ---
  PASS: v7 timestamp is valid

--- Alternative Formats ---
  PASS: toHex() returns 32-char string
  PASS: toBase64() returns 22-char string

--- Nil and Max UUIDs ---
  PASS: UUID.zero() is all zeros
  PASS: zero UUID reports isNil() == true
  PASS: regular UUID reports isNil() == false
  PASS: UUID.max() is all ones

--- Comparison Operators ---
  PASS: == operator works for equal UUIDs
  PASS: != operator works for different UUIDs
  PASS: zero < max is true
  PASS: max > zero is true
  PASS: zero <= zero is true
  PASS: max >= max is true
  PASS: ordering works with known values (small < large)

--- Practical Use Case ---
  PASS: Multiple generated UUIDs are all unique

=== Test Summary ===
Passed: 31
Failed: 0

All UUID integration tests PASSED!
