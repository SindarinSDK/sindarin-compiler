Initial data: length = 5
Spawned 3 threads capturing same array
Read while frozen: length = 5
After first sync: sum = 150
Read after first sync: data[0] = 10
After second sync: first = 10
After third sync: last = 50
After writes: data[0] = 100, length = 6
SUCCESS: Multiple freeze/unfreeze works correctly
