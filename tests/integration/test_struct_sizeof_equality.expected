=== Testing sizeof operator ===
sizeof(int) = 8
sizeof(long) = 8
sizeof(double) = 8
sizeof(float) = 4
sizeof(byte) = 1
sizeof(bool) = 1
sizeof(char) = 1
sizeof(int32) = 4

sizeof(Point) = 24
sizeof(Rectangle) = 48
sizeof(SmallStruct) = 16

sizeof p = 24
sizeof r = 48
sizeof s = 16
sizeof(p) = 24
sizeof(r) = 48

sizeof(Point) + sizeof(Rectangle) = 72
sizeof(Point) > 8

=== Testing struct equality ===
p1 == p2: true (expected)
p1 == p3: false (expected)
p1 != p3: true (expected)
p1 != p2: false (expected)

r1 == r2: true (expected)
r1 != r3: true (expected)

All tests completed.
